\title{Run Simple Test of how X->Y (or bYX) relationship is moderated by Z for Outcomes X}
\usage{
modXY(data, Z, xSet, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{dataset in a PSI long format}

\item{Z}{moderator variable (it will be standardized)}

\item{xSet}{location of the set of variables that will be explored as moderated by Z (one at a time)}

\item{Y}{the dependent variable (often "likelihood" - but not necessarily)}
}
\value{
Will return the main effects of the outcomes, and their z-moderated effect
}
\description{
This will run and extract single-mediator moderated-mediation models
('Model 1' in Wood, Harms, & Cho, 2023) for all measured potential mediators of the
[Action->Likelihood] association.
