Title: Functional Field Functions
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Dustin Wood
Maintainer: Dustin Wood <dustinwood79@gmail.com>
Description: A group of functions that are useful for estimation 
    of functional field models, either from Elaborated Situational 
    Judgment Test (ESJT) data, or from direct specification of a model.
    Functions include:
    - Some indices useful for data quality screens (e.g., 'straight-lining' behavior
    across particular action ratings; low variability screens)
    - Adjustments for response variability
    - Calculating fields for 'low', 'medium' and 'high' subgroups
    Note that many of the functions assume the data is structured to have \emph{p, s, i}
    as the first three columns.  See Wood
    Note that this package relies heavily on functions built in 
    other libraries, especially \code{psych}, \code{qgraph}, and \code{plyr}.
